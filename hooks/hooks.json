Extract the project name from the current working directory (just the last segment, e.g. 'cohouser' not the full path). Write a 1-3 line STRATEGIC summary of what was accomplished -- focus on the 'why' and the area of the product or business this touched, not tactical details like file names or line numbers. Append a single JSON line to ~/.claude/daily-journal/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl (using today's date, creating the file if needed) with this format: {\"timestamp\": \"<ISO 8601>\", \"project\": \"<name>\", \"summary\": \"<strategic summary>\"}. Use the Bash tool with a single echo+append command. Do not include any other output."
